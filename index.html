                    The riverine country of Bangladesh (“Land of the Bengals”) is one of the most densely populated
                    countries in the world, and its people are predominantly Muslim. As the eastern portion of the
                    historical region of Bengal, the area once formed, along with what is now the Indian state of West
                    Bengal, the province of Bengal in British India. With the partition of India in 1947, it became the
                    Pakistani province of East Bengal (later renamed East Pakistan), one of five provinces of Pakistan,
                    separated from the other four by 1,100 miles (1,800 km) of Indian territory. In 1971 it became the
                    independent country of Bangladesh, with its capital at Dhaka.
